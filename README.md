# .emacs.d
Emacs config 🤓

## About

This is my personal Clojure preferences folder. I mostly got it from the config provided with:
[Clojure for the Brave and True](http://www.braveclojure.com/basic-emacs/).

I'm just now learning emacs, so if you find yourself here and have suggestions feel free to reach out!
