## About

This is my personal Clojure preferences folder.

## Requirements

- `clj-kondo` must be on your $PATH
- `brew install ag` (for searching)
- `brew install pandoc` (for Markdown mode)

## Using Straight

```
M-x straight-pull-all        # Update all packages
M-x straight-freeze-versions # Write lock file
M-x straight-thaw-versions   # Revert packages to lock file
```
