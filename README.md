Emacs config ðŸ˜Ž

## About

This is my personal Clojure preferences folder. I mostly got it from the config provided with:
[Clojure for the Brave and True](http://www.braveclojure.com/basic-emacs/).

I'm just now learning how to use emacs, so if you find yourself here and have suggestions feel free to reach out!

## Using Straight

```
M-x straight-pull-all        # Update all packages
M-x straight-freeze-versions # Write lock file
M-x straight-thaw-versions   # Revert packages to lock file
```
